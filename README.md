# Vapor4WebAuthentication

When I set out to play with Vapor, what I was looking for was a nice example of how to do authentication, for a website and not an API, using Vapor 4.0.

This proved to be hard to find, as Vapor 4 is quite new!

There are lots of Vapor 3 examples, but the API has changed quite a bit. Certainly enough to confuse a noob like me.

There are a few Vapor 4 examples, but they focus exclusively on token-based authentication for APIs. Transferrable to some extent, but again, confusing for a noob. 

The contents of this repo are the results of me trying to piece together the bits of the puzzle.

Disclaimer:

I am not a web developer or a Vapor expert, nor do I play one on TV. I may have this stuff backwards. If so, please let me know why.
